          <h2>The Story Behind Villa Jure</h2>
          <p>
            Villa Jure, set in the peaceful landscapes of Kaštela, Croatia, is a
            family legacy built in the early 1900s by our great-grandfather.
            Once agricultural land, the villa’s garden still features ancient
            olive trees. <br />
            <br />Crafted from the renowned Brač stone, the house reflects
            timeless quality and tradition. Carefully restored over the years,
            Villa Jure is now a serene retreat between the sea and the
            mountains.
